Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are immature 
myeloid cells with immunosuppressive activity., 
They accumulate in tumor-bearing mice and humans 
with different types of cancer, including hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).,

suppressor cells
CUI: C0038856, Name: Suppressor T Lymphocyte
Definition: subpopulation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes which suppress antibody production or inhibit cellular immune responses.
TUI(s): T025
Aliases: (total: 9): 
	 t cell suppressor, suppressor cell, T suppressor cell, suppressor cells, Suppressor cell, suppressor T lymphocyte, cells suppressor t, Suppressor cells, Suppressor cell (cell)
CUI: C1710252, Name: Suppressor Device
Definition: An electrical device designed to reduce or eliminate unwanted currents.
TUI(s): T073
Aliases: (total: 2): 
	 Suppressor, Suppressor Device
CUI: C1267822, Name: CD4+ CD25+ Regulatory T Cells
Definition: Regulatory T cells that express CD4 and CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor) antigens, with immunomodulating activity. CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of CD25 and the transcription factor Foxp3, are essential in maintaining immunologic homeostasis, preventing autoimmunity by suppressing self-reactive T cells; CD4+CD25+ Tregs may induce tolerance to allogeneic organ transplants such as hematopoetic stem cell transplants (HSCTs).
TUI(s): T025
Aliases (abbreviated, total: 12): 
	 nTregs, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, T-regulatory cell, CD4+CD25+ T lymphocyte, Tr cell, regulatory T cell, CD4+CD25+ T Lymphocyte, T reg, suppressor T cell, CD4+ CD25+ Regulatory T Cells
CUI: C2355611, Name: Suppressor effector T lymphocyte
Definition: T-lymphocytes that respond to signals from suppressor-inducer T-cells by inhibiting either cell-mediated immunity or antibody production by B-cells.
TUI(s): T025
Aliases: (total: 6): 
	 Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocyte, Suppressor effector T lymphocyte, T Suppressor Cell, Suppressor T Lymphocyte, Suppressor-Effector T-Cells, Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes
